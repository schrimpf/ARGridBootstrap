# ARGridBootstrap

This package implements the grid bootstrap of Hansen (1999). 

For teaching purposes, multiple versions of the "same" function are
included. These differences between these versions illustrate various
techniques to improve performance. See [these notes.](https://schrimpf.github.io/ARGridBootstrap.jl/argridboot.html)
